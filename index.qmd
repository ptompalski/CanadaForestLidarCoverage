This webpage is designed to present the current status of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data coverage across Canada's  forested landscapes. We present a collection of maps and descriptive statistics that illustrate the current status and availability of ALS data, specifically focusing on its applications within forestry. Acquisitions over e.g. cities, or data acquired for research projects are not included. 

Information on this website is periodically updated to ensure the most current and accurate representation of ALS data coverage. 

This webpage accompanies the publication by White et al. 2024, and is designed to keep the statistics and maps presented in the paper up to date.

The total area of ALS coverage in Canada is currently `r format(total_ALS_area, scientific=FALSE, big.mark=",")` km^2^, which corresponds to approximately **`r total_ALS_perc`%** of the total land area of the country. The coverage of all forested ecozones is approximately **`r forested_ALS_perc`%**, while the coverage of managed forests is approximately **`r managed_ALS_perc`%**.

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
theTable %>%
  #inlcude only ALS coverage columns
  # select(Jurisdiction, `ALS area (total)`, `ALS area (managed forest)`) %>%
  knitr::kable()  
```


# Maps

The map showing the overall ALS coverage is presented below. Additional [Maps](maps.qmd) show **[acquisition year](maps.qmd#maps-year)**, **[point cloud density](maps.qmd#maps-density)**, and **[areas of multiple overlapping acquisitions](maps.qmd#maps-overlap)**.
