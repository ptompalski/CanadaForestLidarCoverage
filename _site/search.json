    "text": "This webpage is designed to present the current status of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data coverage across Canada’s forested landscapes. We present a collection of maps and descriptive statistics that illustrate the current status and availability of ALS data, specifically focusing on its applications within forestry. Acquisitions over e.g. cities, or data acquired for research projects are not included.\nInformation on this website is periodically updated to ensure the most current and accurate representation of ALS data coverage.\nThis webpage accompanies the publication by White et al. 2024, and is designed to keep the statistics and maps presented in the paper up to date.\nWhite, J.C., Tompalski, P., Bater C., Wulder, M.A., xxx, (2024).
